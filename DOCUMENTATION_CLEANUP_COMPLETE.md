# Documentation Cleanup Complete - backend-ai

## Date: 2025-07-30

## Summary

The backend-ai project has been updated to follow the backend-ai documentation pattern. This project serves as the reference implementation of the documentation hierarchy pattern.

## Documentation Structure

The backend-ai project exemplifies the pattern where:
- **Parent folders contain summaries**
- **Child folders contain implementation details**
- **No duplication between levels**

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Root README provides clear overview
- [x] Each major folder has a README
- [x] No duplicate content between parent/child
- [x] Implementation details are in leaf nodes
- [x] Shared patterns are extracted
- [x] All READMEs link to their children
- [x] CLAUDE.md exists with project rules and recursive read instructions

## Pattern Implementation

This project serves as the template for all other provider-search projects, demonstrating:
- Clean hierarchical documentation
- Extracted shared patterns (e.g., MANAGER_PATTERN.md)
- Clear separation of concerns
- AI-friendly structure

## Note

This completion marker was added to indicate that backend-ai follows the documentation pattern it established. The actual documentation cleanup was completed earlier and this project serves as the reference implementation for all other projects.
