# WebSocket to HTTP Migration Status

## ‚úÖ Features Successfully Reimplemented

### Agent Features
| WebSocket Feature | HTTP Implementation | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Agent Registration | `POST /api/notifications` with type='agent-online' | Agent notifies hub on startup |
| Authentication | Bearer token in Authorization header | `AUTH_TOKEN` env variable |
| Status Updates | `GET /api/status` endpoint | Hub polls every 30s |
| Capabilities Discovery | `GET /api/capabilities` with auto-discovery | Detects installed services |
| Command Execution | `POST /api/execute` with parsed commands | Supports high-level commands |
| Command Parsing | Built into enhanced agent | Parses "restart nginx" ‚Üí systemctl command |
| Event Notifications | `POST /api/notifications` to hub | Monitors CPU/memory and sends alerts |
| Async Commands | `POST /api/execute` with async=true | Returns requestId for tracking |
| Service Discovery | Auto-detects on capabilities request | Checks for common services |
| Service Management | `POST /api/services/:service/:action` | Start/stop/restart/status |

### Hub Features
| WebSocket Feature | HTTP Implementation | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Receive Agent Status | Polling + `/api/notifications` | Hybrid approach |
| Send Commands | `POST` to agent's `/api/execute` | Direct HTTP calls |
| Track Command Results | `/api/notifications` type='command-result' | Agents POST results back |
| Get Command Status | `GET /api/command/v2/:requestId` | Check async command status |
| Handle Events | `/api/notifications` type='event' | Receive system alerts |

## üîÑ Migration Benefits

1. **No Persistent Connections** - Works through firewalls, proxies, load balancers
2. **Stateless** - Agents can restart without losing state
3. **Standard REST** - Easy to test with curl, Postman, etc.
4. **Scalable** - Can add load balancers, multiple hubs
5. **Debuggable** - Standard HTTP tools and logging

## üìù Key Differences

### Authentication
- **WebSocket**: Connected once with headers
- **HTTP**: Bearer token on every request

### Command Flow
- **WebSocket**: Hub sends message, waits for response on same connection
- **HTTP**: 
  - Sync: Hub POSTs to agent, gets immediate response
  - Async: Hub POSTs to agent, agent POSTs result back to hub

### Events
- **WebSocket**: Agent pushes events immediately
- **HTTP**: Agent POSTs events to hub's `/api/notifications`

### Discovery
- **WebSocket**: Agent connects to hub
- **HTTP**: Hub polls agents + agents can notify hub

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Update deployment scripts to use enhanced agent
2. Remove all WebSocket code
3. Update documentation
4. Test full flow with enhanced features
