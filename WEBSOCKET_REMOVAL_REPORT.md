# WebSocket Removal Report

## Date: July 27, 2025

This report documents the complete removal of all WebSocket references from the Backend AI project, transitioning it to a pure HTTP/REST architecture.

## Files Modified

### 1. Type Definitions
- **`shared/src/types/Communication.ts`**
  - Removed `wsEndpoint: string` property from `HubConfig` interface
  - This was a legacy property no longer used in the HTTP-only architecture

### 2. API Comments
- **`hub/api/notification-endpoints.ts`** (line 140)
  - Changed: `// Could also emit via websocket to UI clients`
  - To: `// Could also emit via Server-Sent Events to UI clients`

- **`hub/api/correlation-endpoints.ts`** (line 128)
  - Changed: `// WebSocket endpoint for real-time execution updates`
  - To: `// Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time execution updates`

- **`hub/api/index.ts`**
  - Changed: `No WebSockets!`
  - To: `Pure HTTP/REST architecture`

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Line 54: Changed "WebSocket server for real-time agent communication" to "HTTP polling architecture for agent communication"
- Line 60: Removed "WebSocket" from tech stack list
- Lines 317-319: Changed "WebSocket Events" section to "HTTP API Messages"
- Removed `WS_PORT` configuration from example

#### THREAD_CONTEXT.md
- Line 9: Changed "Express + WebSocket" to "Express + HTTP polling"
- Line 21: Changed "Commands are routed to appropriate agents via WebSocket" to "Commands are routed to appropriate agents via HTTP APIs"
- Line 80: Changed "Hub ↔ Agent: JWT tokens + WebSocket" to "Hub ↔ Agent: JWT tokens + HTTP REST"

#### hub/README.md
- Changed header from "No WebSockets!" to "HTTP Only"

### 4. Compiled Files Deleted
- `hub/dist/api/WebSocketServer.js`
- `hub/dist/api/WebSocketServer.d.ts`
- `hub/dist/index.js` (old version with WebSocket imports)
- `hub/dist/AgentManager.js`
- `hub/dist/AgentManager.d.ts`
- Other compiled files that referenced WebSocket

## Build Process
1. Rebuilt shared module to update TypeScript definitions
2. Rebuilt hub module to ensure no WebSocket references in compiled code
3. All modules now compile cleanly without any WebSocket dependencies

## Verification
- No WebSocket imports remain in the codebase
- No WebSocket type definitions exist
- All documentation accurately reflects HTTP-only architecture
- The system continues to function using HTTP polling and Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

## Architecture Summary
The Backend AI system now operates entirely on:
- HTTP REST APIs for command and control
- HTTP polling (30-second intervals) for agent status
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time execution updates
- No WebSocket connections or dependencies

This completes the WebSocket removal from the Backend AI project.
