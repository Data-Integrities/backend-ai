# Backend AI Restructuring Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Folder Structure Reorganized
- **Hub**: `hub/{api,gui}`
  - API code in `hub/api/`
  - GUI files in `hub/gui/`
- **Agent**: `agent/{api,gui}`
  - API code in `agent/api/`
  - GUI placeholder in `agent/gui/`

### 2. WebSocket Code Removed
- All WebSocket implementations deleted
- HTTP-only architecture enforced
- No more persistent connections

### 3. HTTP Features Implemented
All WebSocket features now work via HTTP:
- Agent registration via notifications
- Status polling (30s intervals)
- Command execution with async support
- Event notifications (CPU/memory alerts)
- Service discovery and management
- Bearer token authentication

### 4. Deployment Scripts Updated
- `deploy-agent-proxmox.sh` - Updated paths
- `deploy-agent-unraid-docker.sh` - Updated paths
- `deploy-agent.sh` - Updated paths
- `deploy-hub.sh` - Already correct

### 5. Build Configuration Fixed
- Hub: `npm run build` creates `dist/api/`
- Agent: `npm run build` creates `dist/api/`
- Both TypeScript configs updated

### 6. Old Folders Deleted
- `agent-proxmox/`
- `agent-windows/`
- `web-agent/`
- `web-hub/`
- `clean-structure/`

## Testing

Both projects build successfully:
```bash
cd hub && npm run build   # ✓ Success
cd agent && npm run build # ✓ Success
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the new hub with: `./deploy-hub.sh`
2. Deploy agents with: `./deploy-agent-auto.sh <hostname>`
3. Test the HTTP endpoints
4. Monitor for any issues

The system is now fully HTTP-based with no WebSocket dependencies!
